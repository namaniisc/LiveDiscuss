# Real-Time Comment System

This project is a real-time comment system built using modern web technologies. The system allows users to post comments that are instantly displayed across multiple devices without the need for a page refresh. It includes live typing notifications and smooth animations for new comments.

## Overview

The project is part of a series of tutorials on building a real-time comment system. In this series, you'll learn how to:

- Build a dynamic front-end interface that updates in real time.
- Set up a Node.js backend using Express.
- Use Socket.io for real-time communication between the client and server.
- Store and retrieve comment data from MongoDB using Mongoose.
- Implement live typing notifications and smooth comment animations.

## Features

- **Real-Time Comment Posting:**  
  Comments are added dynamically without reloading the page.
  
- **Live Typing Indicator:**  
  Displays a message (e.g., "[username] is typing") when a user begins typing.
  
- **Instant Synchronization:**  
  Multiple browser windows or devices reflect new comments and typing statuses in real time.
  
- **Responsive UI:**  
  Built with a custom front-end framework and Bootstrap, providing a modern and responsive design.
  
- **Back-End Integration:**  
  Comments are persisted in MongoDB, ensuring data is stored and retrieved seamlessly.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:**  
  - Custom front-end framework (referred to as “SDM CS”) and Vanilla JavaScript
  - Bootstrap (with WhatsApp theme builder and “Puls” theme)
  
- **Backend:**  
  - Node.js with Express framework
  - Nodemon for automatic server restarts during development
  
- **Database:**  
  - MongoDB for storing comment data (usernames, comment text, timestamps)
  - Mongoose for object data modeling
  
- **Real-Time Functionality:**  
  - Socket.io for handling live updates and broadcasting events

## Project Setup and Structure

The project follows a structured folder organization:

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-comment-system.git
   cd real-time-comment-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. Then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up MongoDB:**

   - Install MongoDB locally or use a cloud-based instance.
   - (Optional) Install [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) for a graphical interface to view your collections.
   - Update the connection URL in `db.js` if necessary (default: `mongodb://localhost:27017/comment`).

## Usage

1. **Start the Server:**

   Use Nodemon for development to automatically restart the server on changes:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   (Make sure your `package.json` scripts are configured with a dev script that runs Nodemon on your server file.)

2. **Open the Application:**

   Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port specified in your environment).

3. **Interacting with the App:**

   - **Posting Comments:**  
     Enter your name (via a prompt or login session) and a comment. The comment will appear instantly on all connected clients.
   - **Live Typing Indicator:**  
     As you type, a live “typing…” indicator will display, showing that a user is actively composing a comment.

## API Endpoints

- **POST `/api/comments`:**  
  Receives JSON payloads containing a username and comment text.  
  Example payload:

  ```json
  {
    "username": "JohnDoe",
    "comment": "This is a test comment."
  }
  ```

- **GET `/api/comments`:**  
  Retrieves all stored comments from the MongoDB database.

## Testing and Verification

- **REST Clients:**  
  Use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to test the API endpoints.

- **Database Verification:**  
  Use MongoDB Compass to verify that comments are successfully stored in the database with correct timestamps.

## Future Enhancements

Future updates to the project may include:
- Additional user authentication and session management.
- Advanced real-time features and error handling.
- Enhanced UI/UX with more interactive elements.
- Further modularization and refactoring of the code.
